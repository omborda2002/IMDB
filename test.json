    "story": "Fred Hampton, a young, charismatic activist, becomes Chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party - putting him directly in the crosshairs of the government, the FBI, and the Chicago Police. But to destroy the revolution, the authorities are going to need a man on the inside.So lets start with the good. The cinematography and period setting is top notch and really puts you in the era. The acting is very good and helps with holding together a porous story.Now for the bad. I really really wanted to love this movie. But...If youre looking for a biopic of Fred Hampton, this aint it. Plain and simple. If youre looking for a movie that tells you more than you already knew about an understated important figure in black history, again this aint it.What you will get is a movie about an FBI informant whos motives are questionable at best, that happens to have Fred Hampton featured in it. If youre not versed in the names of people in Hamptons inner circle, you will be confused and have a hard time remembering whos who, as characters come and go constantly, with virtually no character development.The movie is entertaining for the most part as the acting is quite good. But the story itself is all over the place and some scenes are longer than they need to be. You wont know much more about the great Fred Hampton, than you did before you watched this movie. Its too bad because I was waiting for this one.People will trip over themselves to give this positive marks, but as a student of history and someone who loves a good drama in a period piece, this movie missed a great opportunity for sure.",
