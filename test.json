With enough twists and turns to cause whiplash, Inside Edge is your window into the world of the powerful men and women who run the game behind the game, who will stop at nothing to get what they want. Their ambition is an all-consuming force, a vortex of deceit, lust, greed, manipulation and betrayal that threatens to destroy the very sport they swore to protect. —OfficialLOved this attempt and we should all welcome this kind of efforts. The best thing of this series is performances by all actors. We can link many scenes , dialogues to current situations. Few scenes look filmy off course but then we have president candidate killing people in house of cards so...I liked it.. Thanks Amazon.. Indian TV-series needed this..",
